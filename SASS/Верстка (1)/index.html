			<p>We are a team of enthusiasts passionate about tire technologies, who once decided to create a place where every car owner can find "eternal" tires at favorable prices. So in 2010 the store "FIRE TIRE" appeared. It all started in 2010 with a small garage business of two eccentric friends, Michael and John. These two crazy tire geeks with shining eyes decided to dedicate their lives to finding eternal, indestructible car tires. Their mania was to create a paradise where American motorists could forget about punctures, repairs and tire changes forever.</p>
			<p>They started with something simple - they bought old, decommissioned army tanks and separated the tires from them. They soaked them with a special secret compound, turning them into practically invulnerable masterpieces of tire making. That's when the name "FIRE TIRE" was born, personifying their dream of creating an ideal place for motorists. The friends opened their first store in a small garage on the outskirts of New York. Its assortment consisted of only a few dozen tank tires, but the demand for them was simply staggering! Customers literally stormed the garage to get their hands on these legendary specimens.</p>
			<p>Seeing such excitement, Michael and John realized that they had hit the mark. They began to rapidly expand the business - opening new stores across the country, hiring staff, and establishing supplies. In a couple of years, "FIRE TIRE" turned into a chain of retail outlets from New York to Los Angeles. And then the friends took a revolutionary step - they launched their own online store. Now customers could order the legendary "eternal" tires from "Tire Paradise" even from the other end of the country! Couriers delivered goods to the most remote corners of America, where previously it was impossible to get a single decent tire.</p>
